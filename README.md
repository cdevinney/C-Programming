# C-Programming
This repository contains all my coding projects as I learn C. They are basic programs to learn aspects of the C language.

Program Descriptions
====================
helloWorld.c outputs the greeting "Hello, World"

testVSCrun.c tests VSCode running and commits to Github. It outputs "Does this work?"

helloName.c asks for the user's name and outputs "Hello, [name]!"

numberGuessing.c prompts a user to guess numbers between 1 and 50 until they guess a random number that is seeded by time. User input is validated.
